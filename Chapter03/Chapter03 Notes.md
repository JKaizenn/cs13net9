### Operating on Variables
Operators apply simple operations such as addition and multiplication to operands such as variables and literal values.

- Most operators are binary, meaning they work on two operands.
- Examples of binary operators:
  ```
  int x = 5;
  int y = 3;
  int resultofAdding = x+y;
  int resultOfMultiplying = x * y;
  ```
